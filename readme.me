Vector: Vector is more efficient when previously you know how many items need
and do not need increase space for add new items.

For example : "You need input exactly five numbers because a wizard will find out"
all numbers".

ArrayList: It's more flexible than Vector. It's more useful when you previously dont
know numbers of item to storage.

For example: You need a repository that contains objects but you do not how many will
storage.
